# Hey, I'm Dan 👋

I'm a builder, operator, and product generalist.

For the past 10 years, I've worked in early-stage startups - writing code, shaping product, leading teams, and scaling from zero to real revenue. Most recently, I helped take [Risk Ledger](https://riskledger.com) from pre-seed and no customers to $10m+ ARR, 65+ people, and a platform used by 150+ enterprises.

In October 2025, I stepped away to take a year out - travelling, slowing down, and making space for whatever comes next.  
You can follow that journey here → [mckenz.io/travel](https://mckenz.io/travel)

Right now: somewhere on the road, thinking about what to build next.
